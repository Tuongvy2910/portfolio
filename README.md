# About Me
I am a person with a positive mindset and a rather perfectionistic nature. In everything I undertake, I always aspire to achieve the most refined and aesthetically pleasing results, paying meticulous attention to even the smallest details.

I am currently gearing up to receive a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management at the University of Finance Marketing. With the knowledge I have acquired, I find myself particularly intrigued by software testing techniques. It seems to align well with my personality, and my ability to analyze systems has been fairly well-regarded.The prospect of delving into the intricacies of software testing excites me, as I derive satisfaction from attaining optimal outcomes. I believe that my meticulous nature will contribute positively to this field, and my capacity for system analysis has been assessed quite favorably.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
